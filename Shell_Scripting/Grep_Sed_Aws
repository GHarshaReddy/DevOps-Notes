Most Important Linux Commands

GREP - Global Regular expression print

If we want findout a word from long file, we can use grep 

cat filename | grep "word" = This shows lines with the given word
We can also use grep "word" --color

SED - Stands for stream editor 

It is used for substitution, find and replace words.
Also used for text manupulation and deleted
eg:

echo hi bro | sed 's/hi/bye'

echo hi bro | sed 's/hi/bye/g' = changes all with hi

will be turned to bye

cat filename | sed 'saba/s/hi/bye' = Here we used /s in between so, it will look for lines which has saba word in it then it will replace hi to bye

cat filename| sed 's/hi/bye;s/hello/jello' = changes multiple words using ;

cat filename | sed 's/^/https;\/\//' = Adds https:// to starting of all lines

hat ^ is used when we want to find something intial of the file. $ is used when we want to find something at the end of the file. d is used for deleted.

cat filename | sed '/^$/d' = Removes all the white pages in the file

-r flag = rejects 

cat filename | sed -r 's/[0-9]//'

-y flag is used for transformation 

cat filename | sed 'y/[a..z]/[A..Z]' = characters will turn to capitals

cat filename | sed '-e 's/com/abc' -e 's/in/abc' = replaces com with abc and in with abc. -e flag helps to run multiple commands in single line

====

AWK Command

Aho, Weinberger Kernighan

Its not just a command, its a kind of small scripting language used by many programmers

Lets say if we have a long document and we find a word 'shifa' and what to do when we find the word can be done with awk

cat filename | awk '{print $1}' = prints the first column of the lines

cat filename | awk '/shifa/ {print $2}' = finds the liens which has the word shifa and prints second column of it

-F helps to find paticular word or character

cat filename | aws -F '.' '{print $1}' = prints column 1 before dot

aws '{s+=$1} END {print s} filename = adds sum of the values of colum 1

Task

Try editing big file in linux using grep, sed, and awk

sort -u = removes duplicate results
